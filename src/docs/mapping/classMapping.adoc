=== Class Mapping

==== root

Determine if the domain class will have its own index or not.
Take a boolean as parameter, and is set to `true` by default.

[source,groovy]
----
class Preference {
    static searchable = {
        root false
    }
    // ...
}

class Tag {
    static searchable = true
    // ...
}

class Tweet {
    static searchable = {
        message boost:2.0
    }
    // ...
}
----

In this code, the classes `Tweet` and `Tag` are going to have their own index.
The class `Preference` will not.
It also means that any search request will never return a Preference-type hit.
The dynamic method `search` will not be injected in the `Preference` domain class.

The domains not root-mapped can still be considered searchable, as they can be components of another domain which is root-mapped.
For example, considered the following domain:

[source,groovy]
----
class User {
    static searchable = {
        userPreferences component:true
    }

    Preference userPreferences
}
----

When searching, any matches in the `userPreferences` property will be considered as a `User` match.

==== all

Set default analyzer for all domain class fields.

[source,groovy]
----
static searchable = {
  all = [analyzer: 'russian_morphology']
}
----

[source,groovy]
----
static searchable = {
  all = false
}
----

When disabling the all field, it is a good practice to set index.query.default_field to a different value (for example, if you have a main 'message' field in your data, set it to message).
